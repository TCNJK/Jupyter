Mooc6_Quiz2 Q3: Which of these examples of personas could be more effective for guiding a design solution?
#1
Persona 1
Project Manager in Training Unit
Jorge is 35 years old, for years he used to work as a trainer in his country. Three years ago,
he joined Training Unit and keeps on organizing Training Activities — approximately 5 per
year. He considers himself as an experience Project Manager and distributes his knowledge
to Training Unit newcomers. He is barely interested in new technologies and a bit sceptic
towards new ICT system. However, he hopes that it will take away at least a bit of the
administrative burden from him, so he can really focus on the content of the training course,
not on the organizational matters.

Persona 2
Assistant
Julie works in the same team as Jorge. She is 30 years old, pretty fresh in her organization.
One year ago, she has been assigned to support Jorge in his activities. However, she is also
supporting 4 other Project Managers. She likes new technologies, in her free time she is
using social media. Working in Training Unit is not maybe her dream, but she appreciates the
stability. Julie would like to find the easiest way to keep the meeting data from all the
meetings she support in a similar way. Otherwise, it is very complicated for her to find
requested information.

Persona 3
Head of Unit
Adam is 55 years old and with vast experience in his area of expertise — training. He joined Training Unit 6 years ago and was leading it through many changes. Now, the Unit is growing rapidly and Adam feels a bit lost. He receives the updates from Project Managers, but he doesn’t have the opportunity to follow the meetings on his own. He is also frustrated with complaints received from assistants and Project Managers taking over someone else's project. They seem never to be able to find required information.

Mooc6_Quiz2 Q4: Read the project brief, then the scenario. What conclusions might you draw from the scenario that would inform the design? (Select all that apply)
PROJECT BRIEF

In a world afflicted by famine, poverty and inefficiencies, half of the total available food [1]
is (especially in the western world) wasted due to a thought totally conformed to aesthetic
standards before of quality (for what concerns the buyers), and to economic pressures on
the market (for what concerns the goods exchange and globalisation). This can lead to
catastrophic consequences on the social (scuffles), environmental (land consumption, water
shortage) and, in the end, on geopolitical equilibrium.

The main question is: can a software improve the quality and quantity of food
consumption in a modern social way?

The system is called “Foodealize”, resembling the union of the words “Food” and “Realize”
or ’Idealize” (letting the users imaging which fits more to them).

Foodealize is a platform born by taking into account all the issues arisen by the users that
are concerned about the lack of long-term vision about food redistribution over the
population; in particular, wants to provide its users a useful set of tools that can help them
to accomplish their needs of eating (if they act as “consumers”) and their need to share
(whether they act as “producers”), keeping always an eye to the possibility to make
business.

As this system will run under the form of mobile application, it will give to the users the
possibility to get the advantage of the built-in device sensors (like GPS), as well as the
connectivity capabilities that pervade our lives in the last decade.

Last but not least, a robust centralized infrastructure will be “behind the scenes” to
guarantee a proper service to the users: in fact, a client-server architecture is the only one
that can provide the data durability and the coordination of the activities between the
application installed on multiple devices.

George
George is a 32 years old owner of a fry shop based in Los Angeles. He is getting a pause with his business consultant discussing how important nowadays is the efficiency aspect when applied to storage of products. One of his colleague, Robert, says that the last year, thousands of pounds of unsold food have turned out to be a great loss and advises George to employ a manager for his company.

Unfortunately, George does not have enough money to have a manager so he decided to rely on information technology. After a couple of weeks, his friend Jessica, owner of a pizzeria in Tucson, tells him about an app called "Foodealize" that can help him to reduce losses. Can it be true? It’s Friday evening and George will close the shop in about one hour. Unfortunately, many hamburgers and chips are left unsold so he decides to rely on Foodealize: on the screen appears the possibility to create a “leftover selling” which automatically suggests an offer of 2$ for each of the ten hamburgers unsold, so he takes a photo and puts it on the platform. After 5 minutes, Mary Smith books two hamburgers, and after two minutes more, James Caves asks for 4 hamburgers. After ten minutes, James Caves comes to the shop and pays George 8$ for his hamburgers. At the end of the working day, Mary Smith didn’t come so George gives her profile a “dislike” vote while giving James a “like” vote. George is satisfied in any case because he earned 8$ dollars instead of throwing 4 good hamburgers away. 
A. George needs the app to work efficiently, since he will likely be using it at the end of the day and will only have a short period to sell the leftover food 
B. Consumers need to find out about the food availability right when it is posted, since it will likely be at the end of the day. Pushing notifications to consumers when food is posted would be useful in the app 
C. The app’s success will rely on users following through on picking up their purchases; making users pay in-app rather than in the store will increase the likelihood that all the food is picked up 
D. George does not care about making money since he is throwing the food away anyways, so all the leftover food should be posted on the app for free Answer: A, B, C
